# BookExchange

Creating a book exchange website for Wheaton College, MA. Its main use will be for students with leftover textbooks to pass them along, possibly for a fee, to new students needing them for the following semesters.

### New Plan

As of 6/18/14, this site has a planned overhaul. It will likely be vastly simplified as a single-page web app, with a (hopefully) very intuitive interface for addition and viewing of offers, and later a search interface.
